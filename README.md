# OS-Flip 🌀

*A Linux terminal tool to view, set, and flip your default boot OS.*

---

## ✨ Overview

**OS Flip** is a Python-based utility to manage boot preferences on Linux systems using GRUB2. Whether you're running a dual-boot setup or switching between multiple Linux distributions, OS Flip gives you a simple terminal UI to:

* 🔍 View bootable OS entries
* ✅ Set the **default OS**
* 🔁 Temporarily flip into another OS for one-time boot

---

## 🖥️ Platforms Supported

* 🐧 **Linux only** (GRUB2-based bootloaders)

> Windows and macOS are **not supported**. Windows does not allow GRUB changes, and macOS/Boot Camp setups are incompatible. Any Linux distribution should manage BIOS/UEFI defaults through firmware settings.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 🧠 Auto-detects current OS
* 📜 Lists all GRUB boot entries
* ✅ Set permanent default boot entry
* 🔁 Flip OS temporarily (one-time boot)
* 📁 Logs activity to a Linux-specific log file

## 📝 Custom Shortcuts (Advanced)

### 1. Using a Text File

You can automate OS Flip actions using a simple **text file shortcut**.
For example, create a text file named `win_boot.txt` containing:

```
2
1
y
```

**Meaning:**

* `2` → Choose **Flip OS**
* `1` → Select OS option `1` (e.g., Windows Boot Manager) for **one-time boot**
* `y` → Confirm and reboot immediately

Run it with:

```bash
sudo os-flip < win_boot.txt
```

---

### 2. Create a Quick Command (Alias)

To make this even faster, add a shortcut to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias flip='sudo os-flip < /path/to/win_boot.txt'
```

After saving and reloading your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`), just type:

```bash
flip
```

…and your system will **instantly flip and reboot into the selected OS**.
